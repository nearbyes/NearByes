Terms of Service
Last updated: 10/03/2024

Welcome to NearByes! These terms outline the rules and regulations for using NearByes or services. By creating an account on NearByes or using NearByes, you agree to comply with these terms. If you disagree with any part of these terms, please refrain from using our services. 

Intellectual Property
The content on NearByes, including text, images, logos, and trademarks, is protected by intellectual property laws. You may not use, reproduce, or distribute our content without our explicit permission. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of NearByes, and you also shouldn’t try to translate NearByes into other languages or make derivative versions. NearByes itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Najib Belkhayat Zoukkari. 
You understand and agree that Najib Belkhayat Zoukkari is not responsible for the profile pictures or content posted by other users, and we do not endorse or support any messages or informations contained therein.
We reserve the right to make changes to NearByes or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for NearByes or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.

The NearByes app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to NearByes secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the NearByes app won’t work properly or at all.

The NearByes app does use third-party services that declare their Terms and Conditions.

Najib Belkhayat Zoukkari will not take any responsibility for any use you make of NearByes. Certain functions of the NearByes will require the app to have an active internet connection and your location data. Najib Belkhayat Zoukkari does not take the responsibility for the NearByes app not working at full functionality.

If you’re using NearByes outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing NearByes, or other third-party charges. In using NearByes, you’re taking responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use NearByes outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using NearByes, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.

Along the same lines, Najib Belkhayat Zoukkari does not take responsibility for the way you use NearByes. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Najib Belkhayat Zoukkari is not responsible.

Najib Belkhayat Zoukkari accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on the functionalities of NearByes.

At some point, we may wish to update NearByes. Najib Belkhayat Zoukkari does not promise that it will always update NearByes so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android & iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to NearByes when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing NearByes, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using NearByes, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
The services of NearByes are not guaranteed. Some or all functionalities may not be available occasionally or indefinitely. Najib Belkhayat Zoukkari do not ensure any responsibility regarding any damage or concern that may occur during this unavailability.
